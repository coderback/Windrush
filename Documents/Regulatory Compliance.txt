Regulatory and Compliance Considerations
Building a job platform in the UK means we must strictly adhere to certain regulations and best practices, both to avoid legal issues and to build trust with our users. Two main areas stand out: data protection (GDPR) and immigration/employment regulations (Skilled Worker visa sponsorship rules, anti-discrimination laws, etc.).
GDPR & Data Protection: Since we handle personal data of EU/UK individuals (profiles, CVs, etc.), GDPR compliance is mandatory. Concretely, this entails:
Lawful Basis & Consent: We will obtain explicit user consent for collecting and processing their data during signup (with unticked checkboxes for agreeing to terms). We will clearly explain what data we collect and why

 (e.g., we need their information to match them to jobs and to allow employers to evaluate them). Sensitive data (like any optional diversity info) will only be collected with explicit consent and stored with extra care

.
Privacy Policy: We’ll maintain a transparent Privacy Policy in plain language

, which details the data we collect, how we use it, how long we retain it, and user rights

. For example, it will state that user profiles may be visible to employers, applications will be shared with target companies, and we won’t sell data to third parties. We’ll also declare any third-party processors (e.g. if we use analytics or cloud providers) and ensure they are GDPR-compliant through Data Processing Addendums.
User Rights: We will implement mechanisms for users to exercise their rights:
Right to Access: Users can request a copy of their data – we can provide a downloadable profile and application history JSON or PDF on request

.
Right to Rectification: Users can edit their profile information any time to correct inaccuracies

.
Right to Erasure: A user can delete their account, which will purge or anonymize their personal data from our systems (except data we are required to keep for legal reasons). We’ll implement a “Delete Account” function that removes PII and perhaps keeps non-identifiable info (like application stats) in aggregate.
Right to Portability: We could allow users to export their profile in a standard format (CSV or JSON)

, which could also serve the access request.
Right to Object/Restrict: Users can opt out of certain processing (e.g. they might object to us using their data for marketing emails – we’ll honor unsubscribe requests promptly, and provide settings to opt out of newsletters or non-essential emails).
Data Minimization: We commit to only asking for data that is relevant to the job search purpose

. For instance, we don’t ask for unnecessary personal details like marital status or a photograph (unless the user chooses to add a profile picture). We won’t collect sensitive data (race, religion, health) except possibly if user voluntarily provides for diversity purposes, but even that we might avoid to keep things simple and unbiased.
Data Retention: We will define clear retention periods for different data. E.g., inactive user accounts (no login for, say, 2 years) may be deleted after sending a warning notification

. Job application data might be kept for a certain period (perhaps 1-2 years) in case of audit or user reference, but we’ll not keep it indefinitely. We’ll implement automated cleanup scripts for old data once the retention period passes. This avoids accumulating data that could pose risk and ensures compliance with the principle “store data only as long as necessary”

.
Security Measures: GDPR mandates protecting personal data. Our security design (encryption, access control, etc.) addresses this. We’ll also have a procedure for data breaches: if a breach occurs, we know we must notify the ICO within 72 hours and possibly affected users

. To mitigate risk, we’ll encrypt sensitive data at rest (especially any special category data if present, and CV files might be encrypted or at least access-controlled). Backups will also be protected. Employee access to data will be limited – for instance, admin support staff might see user profiles to help them, but sensitive fields like password hashes are never visible. We’ll train any staff on data protection responsibilities.
We may appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO) if required (likely not mandated until we grow, but we will at least assign someone to be responsible for privacy compliance)

.
Cookies & Tracking: We will use cookies mainly for login sessions and maybe Google Analytics. We’ll show a cookie consent banner allowing users to opt out of analytics cookies. No invasive tracking or sharing with ad networks without consent.
Complying with GDPR not only avoids fines but is good business practice – it builds user trust because we show respect for their personal data.
UK Visa Sponsorship & Employment Law Compliance: Since our platform specifically deals with visa sponsorship jobs, we have a responsibility to ensure information is accurate and not misleading. Key considerations:
Approved Sponsors Only: We will only list jobs from employers who are licensed sponsors (for relevant visa routes)

. This means vetting companies and cross-referencing the Home Office’s public sponsor register regularly. We might even periodically update our Company database from the official list which is updated by the government. If a company loses its sponsor license, we should stop advertising them (or at least flag it). This ensures users don’t waste time on jobs that can’t sponsor them. Our compliance to this also keeps us in good standing legally – while it’s not illegal to advertise non-sponsor jobs, our brand is about sponsorship, so we must maintain that integrity.
Accurate Job Information: We should encourage or require employers to include relevant details in postings that relate to visa criteria. For example, the UK Skilled Worker visa has a minimum salary threshold (often around ~£26,000 or the “going rate” for the job)

. If an employer posts a job with a salary below the visa minimum for that role, we should warn them (maybe they intend to sponsor under some different category or it’s a mistake). Possibly, we integrate logic or at least guidelines: e.g., if someone tries to post a full-time graduate role at £18k, that’s below the usual visa threshold – the system could flag “This salary may not meet visa requirements; please confirm if you can still sponsor or adjust the offer”. This way, we indirectly enforce compliance with immigration rules on job ads.
Legal Job Posting Requirements: In UK, job ads must follow equality laws – no discriminatory language (can’t say “UK nationals only” or “young people preferred” etc.). We will have content guidelines and moderate postings. Also, previously Tier 2 had a Resident Labour Market Test requiring advertising for 28 days in certain forums. That rule was abolished in 2021 for Skilled Worker visa, so not needed now, but if such rules come back, we’d incorporate them (e.g., maybe ensure jobs are publicly visible for a time before sponsorship). For some visas like the new post-study work, no sponsor needed, but anyway our scope is mainly sponsored jobs.
GDPR in Recruitment (for employers): We should also guide employers that when they access candidate data through our platform, they too are subject to data protection rules. Likely our terms will state that employers must treat applicant data confidentially and not misuse it. We might implement features like auto-deletion of applicant data for employers after a time, or at least give them tools to comply (e.g., an employer can delete an application record after process, or we auto-remove them after X months).
Tier 2/Skilled Worker Guidelines: We could have a section for employers explaining what’s required to sponsor a visa to ensure they only post legitimate opportunities. For example, the job must usually be a graduate level job (RQF3+), meet salary thresholds, etc.. While enforcement of that isn’t directly our responsibility, providing this info helps employers post appropriate roles and helps candidates understand the viability. If we found an employer consistently posting roles that wouldn’t qualify for sponsorship, we might intervene or discuss with them to avoid confusing users.
Audit Trail: We keep logs of job postings and changes. If ever challenged (say a user claims an employer misled them), we have records of what was posted. For legal safety, our terms will likely disclaim that while we strive to verify sponsors, we are not liable if an employer fails to actually sponsor a candidate (we connect opportunities, but cannot guarantee outcomes). However, we will remove any employer that is found to be acting in bad faith (like advertising sponsorship but then not actually sponsoring).
Employment Law: We must ensure postings comply with working time regulations and minimum wage as well. As a platform, we’re not the employer, but promoting obvious violations could implicate us. So if an employer tries to post a job with salary below minimum wage or requiring excessive hours beyond legal limits, we will reject it. Similarly, internships should be paid if they count as workers by law – we might have to be careful about unpaid internships (maybe only allow if it’s clearly legal like part of a degree and <1 year).
Discrimination and Equality: We will enforce equal opportunity guidelines. Our platform itself should be unbiased – e.g., the AI recommendations should not systematically disadvantage any group. We’ll avoid collecting data like race or religion, which could feed bias. If we use AI, we’ll monitor for any biased outcomes (this is an emerging area of AI ethics). Also, in our communications, we’ll encourage employers to be equal opportunity and possibly allow them to display a “We welcome international and diverse candidates” note.
User Verification: While not a legal requirement, to maintain quality we might verify user identities or educational enrollment (since we target students). For example, Student Circus requires users to sign up with a university email at first. We could partner with universities or use student email verification to ensure our user base is genuine and target audience. This also assures employers that applicants are legitimate candidates.
Data Location: Post-Brexit, UK has its own GDPR (“UK GDPR”), largely same as EU’s. We should ideally host data within the UK or EU. AWS offers London region; we can use that to store data in UK territory, which helps with any data residency concerns and latency for UK users.
Cookies & Marketing Law: UK’s PECR and EU’s ePrivacy mean we need cookie consent for any tracking cookies, which we’ll do. Also, we won’t send marketing emails to users who didn’t opt-in (and we’ll have clear unsubscribe options).
Terms of Service & User Protection: Our Terms will also clarify that we are a facilitator, not an employer, and we don’t guarantee visa or job outcomes. However, we commit to doing our best to list only genuine opportunities. We will include a Code of Conduct that prohibits companies from charging candidates fees (some fraudulent recruiters charge for sponsorship – that’s illegal in UK), and if we find such behavior, those companies will be banned. We also advise candidates to never pay money for a job offer, etc., acting as a protective intermediary.
By implementing these compliance measures, Windrush not only avoids legal troubles but also builds credibility as a trusted platform. Users (especially those unfamiliar with UK laws) can feel safe that their data is handled carefully and that the jobs they find are legitimate visa-sponsoring roles. Compliance is not a one-time task – we’ll continuously monitor legal developments (e.g. if UK changes immigration rules or data laws) and update our policies and system accordingly. Consulting with legal experts periodically (especially as we introduce new features) will be part of the plan to ensure ongoing compliance
