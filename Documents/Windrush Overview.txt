Windrush Job Board Web App Overview
Windrush is envisioned as a UK-focused job board platform dedicated to international job seekers (e.g. students and graduates) searching for employment with visa sponsorship.
 The name is inspired by the Windrush generation (1948â€“1973), symbolizing new opportunities for those coming to the UK. The platform will list jobs (including internships, placement year opportunities, and graduate schemes) exclusively from employers licensed to sponsor work visas, and even enable users to send speculative applications (unsolicited CVs/cover letters) to companies known to hold sponsorship licenses. The goal is to streamline a process that today often requires manually cross-checking government sponsor lists with job postings. Key differentiators will be an AI-driven recommendation engine for personalized job suggestions, support for tailored application documents per job, and a clear focus on UK visa compliance. The system must be designed to handle at least 50,000 users with high scalability, while ensuring security and regulatory compliance (e.g. GDPR data protection and UK Skilled Worker visa guidelines). Below, we outline the functional requirements, non-functional requirements, features, system architecture, database schema, tech stack, development plan, and compliance considerations for Windrush.
